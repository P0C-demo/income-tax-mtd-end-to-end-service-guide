# Customer support model
<!--- Section owner: MTD Programme --->

The Customer Support Model guides HMRC Customers to the most appropriate support. This may be provided by HMRC or the software vendor depending on the issue.

The support offering for Income Tax self-assessment (ITSA) customers includes guidance on GOV.UK, webchat, support links on all HMRC online pages, and support over the phone.

Three live service customer support journeys have been highlighted below as illustrative examples of typical support requests. For testing services HMRC will directly support you and customers through the process.
