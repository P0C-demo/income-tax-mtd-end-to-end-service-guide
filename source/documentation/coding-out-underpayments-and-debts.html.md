# Coding Out

When a Self Assessment customer has PAYE income in addition to business income, HMRC will try to collect any tax due on their final declaration through their tax code for the following tax year. There are some restrictions around this - see [Pay your Self Assessment tax bill: Through your tax code](https://www.gov.uk/pay-self-assessment-tax-bill/through-your-tax-code).

## Collecting MTD debts through the tax code

In future, where an MTD customer with PAYE income in addition to business income has overdue tax charges, HMRC may try to collect this debt via their PAYE tax code.
