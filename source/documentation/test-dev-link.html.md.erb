# About the link
To create an anchor link, you need to do the following:
 - Rename the page, appending .erb. This is to indicate that the page contains embedded Ruby code.
 - Add the link code to the page < % = make_a_link("api-name", "anchor-name", "Link text") % >. The anchor name is the ID of the anchor in the OAS document. The link text is the text that appears in the link.
 - The markup will contain a link to the most recent version of the api. Note that the anchor is all code after the # in the url.
