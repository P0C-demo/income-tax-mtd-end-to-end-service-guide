## Opting out of MTD for ITSA

A manual process is available where a customer or agent can contact HMRC to notify their requirement to unsubscribe from the service.

In the event that the customer continues to be Income Tax registered, if necessary, Income Tax returns can be submitted manually.  The customer does not need to leave the MTD pilot for Income Tax in order to submit a Self Assessment tax return.

In the future, this manual process will be replaced by an online one.
