# Additional Income

## Employments

This suite of endpoints display the PAYE information returned to HMRC by a user’s employers.

The user will be able to add to or supply different employment data after the tax year has ended.  This can include details of missing employments, or financial data.  In addition, the user can choose to ignore the data HMRC holds, for the purpose of their self-assessment calculation.

These endpoints can be broken into three categories:

* details of the employment  
* financial data and benefits from a specific employment
* employment expenses from all of the user’s employments

HMRC will pre-populate the employment information provided by employers. The user should check and correct the information, as necessary, prior to final declaration.

**Note:**

Pre-populated data can only be stopped (ignored) from being used in any tax calculation.

User-generated content:

* can be deleted
* will only be applied in the tax calculation
